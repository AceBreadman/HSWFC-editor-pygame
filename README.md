# HSWFC-editor-pygame
The pygame-based editor that implements HSWFC. In the future, it will be refactored to python files instead of a notebook to get rid of the Jupyter Lab requirement.

# How to run this
1. Clone this repository
2. Open a terminal in that folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. If that finishes, run `jupyter lab --notebook-dir=.` --- The browser should open with Jupyter Lab. 
4. Double click the notebook file in Jupyter Lab's explorer to the left
5. Run the cell (ctrl+enter)

The notebook is littered with comments and docs that explain what all the different parts do. To gain insight into the inner workings and the core idea behind the algorithm, please either check [the paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3582437.3587209), or better yet, check my thesis (once I am done writing!).
